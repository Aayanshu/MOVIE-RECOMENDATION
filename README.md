# Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning with Python

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on a given input movie. It uses **Cosine Similarity** and **TF-IDF Vectorization** to calculate the similarity between movies. The system recommends movies by analyzing various features such as **genres**, **keywords**, **tagline**, **cast**, and **director**.

## Introduction

This **Movie Recommendation System** uses a dataset of movies, extracting features like genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director. These features are then combined into a single text feature for each movie. The **TF-IDF Vectorization** technique is used to convert these text features into numerical feature vectors, which are then used to calculate **Cosine Similarity** to recommend the most similar movies based on a user's favorite movie.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For feature extraction (TF-IDF) and calculating cosine similarity.
- **Difflib**: For finding close matches to the user input movie name.

You can install these libraries using the following pip command:

bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Data Collection
The dataset used for this project is a CSV file that contains information about various movies. The dataset should include the following columns:

title: Movie title.
genres: The genre(s) of the movie.
keywords: Keywords associated with the movie.
tagline: Tagline or slogan of the movie.
cast: The cast of the movie.
director: The director of the movie.
index: A unique identifier for each movie.
Example of how to load the dataset:

python
Copy code
movies_data = pd.read_csv('/path/to/movies.csv')
Make sure to replace the file path with the correct path to your dataset.

Preprocessing
Steps:
Handle Missing Data:

Missing values in the selected columns (genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director) are replaced with empty strings.
Combine Features:

The genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director columns are concatenated into a single string feature for each movie.
python
Copy code
combined_features = movies_data['genres'] + ' ' + movies_data['keywords'] + ' ' + movies_data['tagline'] + ' ' + movies_data['cast'] + ' ' + movies_data['director']
TF-IDF Vectorization:
The combined text features are vectorized into numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
python
Copy code
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
feature_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(combined_features)
Cosine Similarity
The cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between movies. It calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors, with a similarity score close to 1 meaning the movies are very similar, and a score close to 0 indicating dissimilarity.

The cosine similarity is calculated using the feature vectors generated from the combined features:

python
Copy code
similarity = cosine_similarity(feature_vectors)
How to Use
Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.

Download the Dataset: Make sure you have a dataset that includes the columns title, genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director, and index.

Run the Code:

Open a Jupyter notebook, Google Colab, or any Python IDE.
Load the CSV file containing the movie dataset.
Execute the provided Python code for the recommendation system.
Enter Your Favorite Movie:

When prompted, input the name of your favorite movie.
The system will return a list of movies that are most similar to the one you entered.
